            <h1>Maternity</h1>
            <p>If you are expecting a baby then you are probably feeling a huge range of emotions: excitement, anticipation and above all the feeling of unconditional love for this new life that is growing within you. It is without question one of the most magical times in a woman’s life. A pregnant woman’s body is beautiful and unique. My aim is to make you feel completely at ease and to enjoy every moment of your session and to ensure that you receive images that you will truly love.</p>
            <h3>When to book</h3>
            <p>Between 32-36 weeks of pregnancy is an ideal time for your photo session. Combine your maternity images with your newborn images to create a beautiful, storytelling book.</p>

                                <p>I recommend going on location for these sessions to provide your children with beautiful open spaces to play, explore and be themselves. I can travel to a park, the beach, client homes or anywhere within reasonable travel in Melbourne (please note travel fees may apply) and also have favorite locations I can suggest. If you prefer, my studio in Ardeer is also available for family photography sessions.</p>

            <h1>Other Sessions</h1>
            <p>Your growing baby will change enormously in the first 12 months. From a tiny sleepy newborn to a walking, funny toddle and that is all in the space of a year! As an experienced and specialized baby photographer I have the understanding and patience required to pose and photograph your baby to create beautiful and happy images that you will truly adore. </p>
            <h3>When to book</h3>
            <p>Baby photographs can be taken at any age up to 12 months but a great time is between 6-10 months. Ideally when your baby can sit but not yet crawl. Baby photography during this time often reveals your baby at their best – happy, smiley and cheeky, raspberry blowing and even some very serious stares with their personalities already shining through. </p>

                                <p>These sessions take one hour to complete and done at my studio in Ardeer, Vic. or opt for an outdoor session at an agreed location. You must provide all clothing for your baby and children for the session and I will provide all the props and backdrops. A what to wear guide will be forwarded to make shopping or packing a little easier for your session. </p>
                                <p>I like to keep things pure, simple and natural to keep the focus on your gorgeous baby. Your baby will be the star of their baby photography session, however parents and siblings can also be included to make it a family affair.</p>
