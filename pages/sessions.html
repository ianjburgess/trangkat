            <h1>Newborn</h1>
            <p>Many congratulations on the arrival of your new baby and thank you for choosing me to capture the purity and essence of your newborn. My aim is to give you a relaxing and beautiful photographic experience together with precious images for you to treasure for a lifetime.</p>
            <h3>When to book</h3>
            <p>Newborn sessions are best scheduled within the first three weeks of life (ideally between 5-12 days) It’s when they remain sleepy and are easily curled into those beautiful, newborn poses. The perfect time to book your newborn session is whilst still pregnant. A tentative newborn session will be made based on your due date and can be changed if your baby arrives earlier or later than expected.</p>
            <p>If you have already had your baby and they are older than 2 weeks, it’s not too late. Please contact me as soon as possible to discuss your best options with me.</p>

                        <div class="modal-body">
                            <p>A newborn session may last 2-3 hours (more if needed), allowing plenty of time for feeding, snuggling, nappy changes and finding the perfect pose. Keeping baby happy enough to get those perfect newborn photos is a complicated process that involves a lot of love, training and patience. As much as your baby needs my patience, I will also need yours.</p>
                            <p>When I am posing your new baby which can only be achieved when he/she is in a deep sleep it is necessary to move their arms and legs and head. During the process your baby is supported all the time. The poses are baby-led and if your baby is not comfortable we will move on. Not all               poses suits all babies.</p>
                            <p>At some points during your session, I may need you to act as my assistant to help settle your bubba, hold props, and blankets or to assist when baby makes a mess during a diaper-less shoot.</p>
                            <p>I will need to use special equipment to control the environment (lights reflectors, white noise, backdrop stand, heater, etc.)</p>
                            <p> I will take every measure to ensure that you and your baby is safe and comfortable throughout the session. Please feel free to use this time to have a seat and relax.</p>

            <h1>Maternity</h1>
            <p>If you are expecting a baby then you are probably feeling a huge range of emotions: excitement, anticipation and above all the feeling of unconditional love for this new life that is growing within you. It is without question one of the most magical times in a woman’s life. A pregnant woman’s body is beautiful and unique. My aim is to make you feel completely at ease and to enjoy every moment of your session and to ensure that you receive images that you will truly love.</p>
            <h3>When to book</h3>
            <p>Between 32-36 weeks of pregnancy is an ideal time for your photo session. Combine your maternity images with your newborn images to create a beautiful, storytelling book.</p>

            <p>Your growing baby will change enormously in the first 12 months. From a tiny sleepy newborn to a walking, funny toddle and that is all in the space of a year! As an experienced and specialized baby photographer I have the understanding and patience required to pose and photograph your baby to create beautiful and happy images that you will truly adore. </p>
            <h3>When to book</h3>
            <p>Baby photographs can be taken at any age up to 12 months but a great time is between 6-10 months. Ideally when your baby can sit but not yet crawl. Baby photography during this time often reveals your baby at their best – happy, smiley and cheeky, raspberry blowing and even some very serious stares with their personalities already shining through. </p>
