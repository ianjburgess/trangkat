She still loves to snuggle up in a womb-like position and is not overly fussy as long as she is warm and snug.\r\nI'm hoping that we can still be eligible for a newborn photo shoot together as I'd hate to miss out on capturing her (and us with her) at this precious age.\r\nIf this is ok, please let me know which dates you have available times for the following weekends of the afternoon of Saturday 22nd - onwards. \r\nThanks,\r\nCarla Silver"
